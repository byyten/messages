Introduction

Think of your favorite messaging app - Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger, etc. - 
and imagine what it would be like if you could build your own. This project will give you a chance to do just that. 
You’ll be building a web app that allows users to send messages to each other.

Assignment

    Keep in mind that the apps we mentioned earlier have entire teams of developers working on them, so you shouldn’t feel 
    the need to go overboard with features in your app. At a minimum, though, your app should include the following core 
    functionality:
        Authorization
        Sending messages to another user
        Customizing a user profile
    Spend some time planning out your app. What will the user interface look like? What will the data model look 
    like? What libraries will you need to use?
    Start building your app by implementing the core functionality in your backend and frontend.
    Deploy your app to the web and showcase it in the submissions below as well as on our Discord. We’d love to see 
    what you’ve built!

Extra credit

    Allow sending images in chat
    Add a friends list that users can add other users to and see when someone is online (alternative: “Add a users list
    to show which user’s are currently online”; same thing except maybe a step or two less since it doesn’t require 
    adding a friend)
    Allow users to create and send messages in group chats
